# eppy-stubs — EnergyPlus {{ eplus_minor }}

Type stubs for [`eppy`](https://github.com/santoshphilip/eppy) generated from
EnergyPlus {{ eplus_minor }}.  These stubs expose strongly typed overloads for
`IDF.newidfobject()` so that static type checkers can validate object keys
and keyword arguments.

## Install

```bash
pip install "eppy-stubs=={{ eplus_minor }}.*"
```

Install this package **alongside** `eppy`.  It is a PEP 561 stub-only wheel
containing `.pyi` files only; there is no runtime code or `py.typed` marker.
Type checkers will automatically discover the stubs on your `sys.path`.

## Provenance

These stubs were generated from EnergyPlus {{ eplus_minor }}.
See `generated_by.json` for the IDD hash and generation timestamp.
