# archetypal-stubs — EnergyPlus {{ eplus_minor }}

Type stubs for [`archetypal`](https://github.com/samuelduchesne/archetypal)
generated from EnergyPlus {{ eplus_minor }}.  These stubs depend on the
matching `eppy-stubs` release and re-export the typed overloads for
`IDF.newidfobject()` so that static type checkers can validate your
EnergyPlus objects.

## Install

```bash
pip install "archetypal-stubs=={{ eplus_minor }}.*"
pip install "eppy-stubs=={{ eplus_minor }}.*"  # installed automatically as a dependency
```

This package is a PEP 561 stub-only wheel.  It includes a minimal
`geomeppy` shim to satisfy the inheritance chain for `archetypal.IDF`.

## Provenance

These stubs were generated from EnergyPlus {{ eplus_minor }}.
See `generated_by.json` for the IDD hash and generation timestamp.
